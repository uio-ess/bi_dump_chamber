# Notes on assembly
## Piece lengths
Central shaft length = 835.05  
fork shaft lengths = 467  
Crossbar length = 295  

## Drill notes
7 total drills = 4 M6 close fit thru holes and 3 half-thru M4 tap guides  
4 M6 close fit thru hole drills:  
3 in cross bar: one in middle and one each 12.5mm from the ends  
1 in central shaft, 12.0 mm from one end (swing pin hole)  

## Tap notes
6 total threaded sections that need to be tapped = 3 M6 and 3 M4  
3 total M6 threads tapped down the center holes of the extrusion:  
2 in forks  
1 in central shaft  
for each of these three M6 threaded sections, there is one m4 thread for locking them with a setscrew, 10mm from the end needing one half-thru hole each  

## Getting Fancy
we COULD machine the ends to be non-flat so that they're locked square (& at 45 degrees)
